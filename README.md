## Project/Goals
* Find out why tuberculosis is still prevalent in todays age
* Identify regions/countries where tuberculosis is most prevalent
* Explore characteristics of these regions that cause an increase in TB cases
* Identify the methods used to collect/estimate data on TB in these regions and see if there is a correlation


## Process
1. Hide the unwanted/null columns from the data source
2. Explore the data using several visualizations
3. Think of a way to answer my questions using visualizations

## Results
* Option 2: TB_Burden_Country
* My main objective was to find out where and why Tuberculosis a mostly curable illness was still prevalent in our time
    * Map visualization was used to identify regions where TB was prevalent
        * Countries in the AFR region exhibited the highest density in TB cases as well as deaths
    * Line graphs showed the trend of deaths by TB through time
        * Advancements in mordern medicine should decrease the death rate of a curable illness such as TB
        * While the rest of the world showed a decrease in mortality rate by TB, the AFR region showed an increase from 20 years ago
    * Bar graphs showed the methods used to estimate incident cases of TB
        * In AFR the main method used to calculate incident cases was by looking at mortality
        * This could explain the low detection rate in the AFR region as most people who suffer from TB do not end up dying
    * Scatter plots showed the relationship b/w the deaths from HIV related TB cases and incident cases
        * Compared to the other world regions, AFR showed a stronger linear relationship b/w them
        * Could also explain lower detection rates as doctors who diagnosed patients with HIV could end up dying form TB

## Challenges 
The dataset provided contained a lot of features, it was challenging to find out which features to use and which not to in order to answer the question I had in mind

## Future Goals
* During the period of 1990 - 2002, there was a global increase in the deaths from Tuberculosis
    * Given more time, I would like to investigate the reasons for this uptick
